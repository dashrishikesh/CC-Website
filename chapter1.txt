Sloka 1.
To my gurus, to the bhaktas of the Lord, to the avataras of the Lord,
to his manifestations, and his saktis, to the Lord whose name is Krsna
Caitanya, I make obeisance. 

Sloka 2.
I make obeisance to Krsna Caitanya and to Nityananda, the sun and
the moon most wonderful, who destroy the darkness and bestow their
blessings, flowering as they rise together over the horizon of Gauda.
